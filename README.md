This is the repository for a set of programs to calculate physical properties from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results developed by Omid Shayestehpour.

It calculates the viscosity from the pressure fluctuations data from a MD simulation using the Einstein and Green-Kubo expressions.
The viscosity is computed from the integral of the autocorrelation function of the elements of the pressure tensor from the CHARMM MD package.
