# Python codes for MD simulation analysis

This is the repository for a set of programs to calculate physical properties from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation developed by Omid Shayestehpour.

## visco.py

It calculates the viscosity from the pressure fluctuations data from a MD simulation using the Einstein and Green-Kubo expressions.
The viscosity is computed from the integral of the elements of the pressure tensor (or their autocorrelation function) from a MD simulation.
